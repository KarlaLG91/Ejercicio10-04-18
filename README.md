# mk-Name verifier - mk module to identify file name format following Illumina conventions.

## About mk-Name verifier

The name verifier module validates whether the files provided, are named following the Illumina conventions [1].

IMPORTANT NOTE: The name verifier module validates only fastaq.gz files.

## Module configuration.

### Input files

Name verifier requires:
..* Multiple files with .fastq.gz index. Sample files must be locates at data/

### Configuration file
The module includes a config. mk file that is currently empty.

## Module description

The module takes multiple fastq.gz files as input and verifies if they are named correctly using mk all. For each input file, the module  identifies the five requered elements needed for a proper labeling. Namely, sample name, sample number, lane number, r$
Each file is evaluated separately and a fastaq.gz.validation file is created to document wheter the following conditions are met for each element:
        * Fields in name.- the name requieres 5 elements.
        * Lane.- the lane number must be from 1-8 only.
        * Read.- there must only be R1 or R2 for each sample.
        * Last segment.- this element should alwasy be 001.
